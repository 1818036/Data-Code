Data and Code
The folder named "DATA&CODE" houses three files, encompassing raw data, code for data organization and preliminary analysis, and data utilized for lasso analysis.
I. The "RAW_data" folder contains the entire set of raw data from the years 2015-2018, which was downloaded from the nhanse data frame for this study.
II. The "PaperCode.R" script represents the programming logic employed for extracting, cleaning, and organizing the data, as well as conducting preliminary analyses. These include tests for equilibrium, descriptive statistics, and weighted univariate logistic analyses.
III. The "LASSO_data.xlsx" file is the result of processing the data using R language, specifically tailored for adaptive lasso analysis within JMP software.
